“Although memory is technically any form of electronic storage, it is used most often to identify fast, temporary forms of storage. If your computer's CPU had to constantly access the hard drive to retrieve every piece of data it needs, it would operate very slowly. When the information is kept in memory, the CPU can access it much more quickly. Most forms of memory are intended to store data temporarily.”
<br><br>
This short explanation from “How Stuff Works” is an write up on the idea of computer memory and how it is most commonly referred to.  In essence, computer memory serves as the bridge between your computer’s brain (CPU) and the storage area (HARD DRIVE).  Picture you are painting  a wall in your home….  We have a few things we may need.  Let’s start with the basics:
<br><br>
You (CPU)<br>
Paint can (HARD DRIVE)<br>
Paint Brush (OPERATING SYSTEM)<br>
<br><br>
So now you are painting a wall but each time you need to get more paint, you need to walk over to the paint can and get more paint(DATA).  The higher you get up the wall and the more painting you do, the more this walk seems like an issue.  Now we introduce a paint tray (RAM/RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY) to hold paint(DATA) temporarily.  Now you only have to go between your paint tray and the wall rather than walking all the way back to the can.  When you are done with the painting job(OPERATION) you empty the paint tray and end the project. In this same idea, when your computer has completed it’s task, it will remove the item from the cache/memory and open up the space for other operations.

I have included this video for reference which uses legos to explain the same idea because let’s be honest…..who doesn't like LEGOS?
