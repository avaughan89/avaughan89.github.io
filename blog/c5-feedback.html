DBC relies heavily on the ability to tackle challenges in the form of pairing sessions.  These scheduled sessions offer a chance to learn about a new subject but also about yourself.
<br><br>
During the course of this unit,  I found that each pairing partner had a different learning style and different approach to tackling challenges.  Personally,  I enjoy a pairing session that flows seamlessly and the roles are blended together.  I emphasize the “check in” time at the beginning of the session, as I believe it sets the mood for the entire pairing.  On the other side of the coin,  pairing with someone who is behind with the subject matter or who has not completed the reading can be both frustrating and challenging.  I found that I got so caught up with my own progress,  I did not stop to think that not everyone was grasping the materials as fast as myself.  Slowing down and explaining concepts reinforced my own understanding of topics and offered me the opportunity to help someone in the process.
<br><br>
One of the most beneficial aspects of the pairing sessions are the feedback you receive following a session.  These posted reviews offer a chance to reflect on one’s strengths and weaknesses and allows you to strive to improve for the next session.  After reading through my feedback,  I found that I agreed with almost everything that was written.  I try to be both understanding and kind when completing the sessions and it seems to show in my feedback.
<br><br>
When it came to writing feedback for other partners,  I found myself rewriting their reviews.  At times I found that I was not offering any advice based on a positive session and would sit back and reflect on what the partner could have done better.  When there was not beneficial feedback to give,  I would often encourage them to read up on extra materials to be more comfortable with the material.  This way, at the very least, they could read their review and come away with something beneficial.
<br><br>
Overall,  I have found that the pairing and feedback aspect of DBC is not only crucial to our learning experience but also enhances our ability to work with others and adapt to different personalities.  Growing up I was never one to be excited about group projects, but I can honestly say that this experience has changed my mind towards working as a group.
