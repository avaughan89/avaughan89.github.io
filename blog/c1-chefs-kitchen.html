              Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
              Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

              The video reenforced my beliefs about the DBC program that I highlighted during my initial search for a coding program.  Rather than focusing simply on the "package" or the end result, DBC has consistently talked about the experience and challenge rather than focusing on getting a job.  When discussing the "package" I found that other programs focused more on how many of their graduates got jobs rather than the experience you would be changing your life for.  This difference in setup is the reason I originally applied for DBC and the same reasons that keep me motivated today.
              <br><br>
              This video did not change my expectations of DBC, but reenforced my excitement for the program.  I promised myself that I would go into this program with everything I had and the video emphasized the "experience."  The idea of benchmark assessments and being able to track your progress allows me the personal control over my future.  Knowing that I am prepared for the on-site program will add to my determination and only fuel my excitement.
              <br><br>
              As I said before,  I am jumping into this program with both feet and fully intend to make the most out of the experience.  As Shareef stated in the video, this program is what you make of it and I do not intend on missing out on what the program has to offer.  The idea of being submerged in an atmosphere with other like minded and motivated individuals to achieve a common goal is exciting.  I am nervous about the abrupt life change I am making in taking this journey, but my excitement for the future far exceeds the nervousness.  My intention for this program is to accomplish my goal of becomming a developer but also to challenge myself at learning a new school and being fully committed to a program.
