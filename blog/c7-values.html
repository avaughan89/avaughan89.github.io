Accomplishment Achievement Competition Confidence Honesty
<br><br>
Achievement - I picked this value because not only the feeling but the word itself stands out to me personally.  When thinking back on the times I have felt happiest, it was at a time of achievement.  I have been through several trying times in my life and being to overcome my struggles has made me the person I am today.  Being recognized for achievements is not necessarily as important as the personal feeling that comes from achieving your goal.
<br><br>
When I think about the words I chose for values that represent my times of happiness,  I feel that I truly do live up to these values.  Many of them are ideas or values that my parents attempted to instill in me as a child and things I find personally important within myself and those around me.
<br><br>
I am a very competitive person by nature but I also highly value helping others and making sure that people do not feel left behind.  I may always want to finish in first place but I sure do not want to leave anyone on the field struggling.  I try to keep an open door policy when it comes to people looking for help and I hope that this attitude carries with me throughout my life.  I know that there are days ahead when I will need much help.
<br><br>
Thinking about these values and this exercise reminded me not only of what is important to me but why I chose to come to DBC in the first place.  I wanted to chase a dream of mine and even when I get down on myself for not being exactly where I want to be,  I know that I am at least following the steps needed to get there.
