                You may find yourself coming across two common terms when dealing with “assigned values.”  They are Arrays and Hashes.  While the difference may come easily to many,  some people may be confused as to what makes them different and when to use them.
<br><br>
The Ruby Documentation compares them as:
<br><br>
Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java. A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array—that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.
<br><br>
A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
<br><br>
So to put that definition in lighter terms, an array organizes its content based on a numbered/ordered system.  A Hash organizes its contents based on “keys” assigned to each value.  Both are used for storing information but how each value is assigned differs.
<br><br>
It can be argued that the two can be used interchangeably but it really comes down to preference in the end.  Do you prefer calling items by their indexed number or do you prefer to call them by a referenced name?
<br><br>
With some practice with each,  I believe that each person will form their own preference.  Codeacademy’s introduction offered just enough information and practice with each to give a basic user a proper introduction.
