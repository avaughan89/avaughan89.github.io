                While this seems to be my intial foray into the world of git, the benefits of version control are clear to the world of programming.  Version Control allows a programmer to track and monitor multiple versions of their project and process "checkpoints" so that one can revert to earlier versions.  Version Control allows for the designer to take more risks when creating code for they can revert to an earlier working "model" at any time.

Git keeps track of the changes to a project by maintaining a log of the edits.  By reviewing this log, a programmer may revisit previous changes and see the comments which have been added.  This tool could possibly be used to research a previous crippling update or research which programmer added a line of code based on their comment.

GitHub is an excellent tool for hosting your code in an offsite repository and allows for multiple programmers to coloborate on a project.  By allowing multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, efficiency is raised with an additional layer of protection for the end product.  GitHub allows for a programmer to select from different licenses to protect their project and allow for both private and public repositories.  Having a stable portal to host your code while also allowing for collaberation provides the industry with an essential tool for desinging software.
