After doing some research online, it seems that the debate between the object orientated and function camps has been raging for some time.  Not only do the two differ on their purpose, they also are used for different purposes and industries.
<br><br>
Object Oriented - Is code written for the purpose of building objects out of smaller objects.  The world is programmed with a set of rules for each object so that the variables can be manipulated in their own way.  Object Orientated programming seems to benefit the writer more when the type of input remains and the operations you may need to perform on that information may change.  As a good comparison,  in the finance world, the type of information is generally the of the same type but the operations that need to be performed on this data may change.  For example,  when dealing with the GDP from each country, the input or money will be of the same type but how we interpret the information may change depending on our needs.  Keeping in mind that Object Orientated is  building objects out of smaller objects, if our functions or methods are not written in a way to account for a change in our interpretation of data, we will run into multiple problems.
<br><br>
Functional Programming - Is code written for the purpose of evaluating an input based on mathematical functions.  Functional programming is ideal for situations when your type of input will be the same and the functions performed on the data will change.  As stated above, when dealing with the same type of information, the code can be written in a way that will accept the same input but will perform different operations on the information depending on the need.  On the opposite side of the spectrum, when the type of information may change, the functions or methods that have been written for a particular type of data may not transfer easily when attempting to change the input.
<br><br>
Some may argue that both camps and strategies offer their advantages but a growing part of the community believes that the two can be used in conjunction with each other.  Functional strategies can be implemented into object orientated code and vice verse.
<br><br>
Taking into consideration the changing landscape of the industry,  the debate over which ideal is best for the job is most likely never to end.
