Making the transition between Ruby and Javascript was more sudden for some us.  One item that stood out more than the others was how information is looped and how their functions are written.
<br><br>
Spending some time with Ruby loops, we learned if we wanted to shorten code to perform a simple task multiple times, we could write a for loop that would take an input and process a block of code on the input for as many times as we needed.
<br><br>
RUBY
<br><br>
Instead of writing:
<br><br>
puts "Hello world, this is number 1"<br>
puts "Hello world, this is number 2"<br>
puts "Hello world, this is number 3"<br>
...<br>
...<br>
...<br>
<br><br>
To get all the way up to 100, we could write a simple for loop to achieve the same goal.
<br><br>
for current_iteration_number in 1..100 do<br>
   puts "Hello world, this is number #{current_iteration_number}"<br>
end<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Here we see that we are taking a an input "current_iteration_number" and setting a range "1..100" and telling it or "do" the block of code : "puts "Hello world, this is number ".  And to insure that it is selecting our current place in our range, we select it with #{current_iteration_number}.
<br><br>
For Javascript, we can achieve the same goal by writing out a “loop” that will follow the same principles.
<br><br>
JAVASCRIPT
<br><br>
for (current_iteration_number = 1; current_iteration_number <=100; current_iteration_number++) {<br>
  console.log("Hello world, this is number "" + current_iteration_number)<br>
};<br>
<br><br>
Here we can see that we are following the same logic but with some different syntax.  We are setting the value of current_iteration_number to 1, telling the code our range is "until the number is less than or equal to 100" and telling it to loop through this method and increase current_iteration_number by 1 each time.
<br><br>
Understanding that the logic  remains mostly the same but with some different syntax makes this transition much more simple.
