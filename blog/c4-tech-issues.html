Following the recent flood of attention that #GamerGate has received in the media,  I believe it is time to retire the word “Gamer” and retire it from our vocabulary.  Simple put, the word groups everyone in the industry and its customer alike under one umbrella.
<br><br>
#GamerGate has now caused an idea of this misogynistic “neck-beard” to be attributed with everyone who happens to pass some time playing video games.  At the end of the day, people who enjoy video games cannot be all lumped together nor treated as the same group.  I like to compare the industry to the music industry, in that there are many genres to choose from which bring about different groups of people.
<br><br>
The media has a habit of reinforcing stereotypes and the idea of a “gamer” has sure been given its stereotype.  The idea that everyone who plays video games is a 14 year old boy who screams expletives in their parents basement is far from the truth. While people work to change this idea in the media, the video game industry must focus on releasing quality content that attracts people from all walks of life.
<br><br>
No matter which genre of video games you enjoy, at the end of the day it should be about how much you enjoy playing them rather than being a part of this “gamer” culture.
<br><br>
I hope that one day this generalization of everyone who plays video games is a thing of the past and that we can all get back to whats important, enjoying video games.
