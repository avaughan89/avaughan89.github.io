                Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.
<br><br>

Phase 0 has been an eye opening experience for me personally.  I went into this program with the expectation to be challenged, but did not realize I would learn so much about myself in the process.  Considering I still am working 40+ hours a week,  I knew that time management was going to be crucial but I am now seeing how important it is to my personal life as well.  Finding a balance between my work, school, and personal life has been a struggle but I am looking at ways to improve this aspect.
<br><br>
So far the most struggling aspect of the program has been “timeboxing” and learning to take breaks when I am struggling on a challenge.  Using the pomodoro technique has been especially useful when struggling on a particular task.  Despite this technique,  I still find myself stuck on problems and focusing myself until I become extremely frustrated.  I am doing my best to use a timer and work to schedule my breaks on time.
<br><br>
Going forward I am going to be more strict with my use of timeboxing and how I approach the challenges.  As my work load decreases and my responsibilities lower,  I believe this issue will also work itself out.  From my previous education I am so used to focusing on a problem until I can solve it,  I am not used to taking breaks and doing other activities to free up my mind.
<br><br>
While I am sure I am not the only one in the program with a busy schedule,  I am hoping to learn from my classmates how they have adapted to the program and what techniques they are using to complete the challenges.
<br><br>
Despite my setbacks thus far,  I could not be more excited for this program.
