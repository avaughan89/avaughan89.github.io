<br><br>
A stereotype is defined as:
<br><br>
“a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.”
<br><br>
So in other words  a stereotype is an idea about something that is simplified and does not change.  In the case of stereotype threat, the stereotype can be damaging someone’s performance about themselves based on the preconceived notion.  When reading through various articles about the subject, the effects of stereotype threat can effect all different types of people.
<br><br>
One of the most common examples of stereotype threat was an african american student doing poorly on the SAT’s because of the stereotype that african americans are not intelligent.  Regardless of how the student may have done, the preconceived idea about his possible stereotype affected his performance.
<br><br>
One example I found to apply to our industry was the idea that women are not as talented and intelligent when it comes to technological fields.  This could affect a possible candidate during her interview if she felt should would do bad in the interview simply because people carry around this stereotype.  I feel that employers and us as employees should seek to demolish the stereotypes that are effecting people and create more welcoming environments.
<br><br>
Just from my own personal experience, I know that the tech industry seems to be making a huge push to hire more women in the field and create a more diverse culture.  This is great for everyone all around and should be encouraged among all industries.  By limiting your hiring pool to 20-30 year old men, you will only give yourself access to a limited pool of ideas and thinking styles.  A team with different genders, ages, and ethnicities has a higher percentage chance of creating multiple solutions to a solution.
<br><br>
I would hate for all women to think the tech industry is a boy’s club and wasn’t welcoming to their efforts and ideas.  Considering how technical and mathematical the field is, one would think that no gender or race could be inherently better at solving a problem.
<br><br>
While a world free of stereotypes and judgment is far from near, if we all do our part to lessen that divide, the world will thank us for it.
